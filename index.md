### CPSC 120 Labs

*Lab 1
  I really liked lab 1 because it showed me the ropes of what coding is. Although it was the simplest lab, I underestimated the first lab and though it was so simple, it was still nearly impossible to code. Coding in general should never be underestimated as I knew what I was getting myself into. I liked this lab because it also showed me the fundamentals of coding we all got into.

*Lab 2
  I really enjoyed lab 2 because it was the madlib lab. This lab gave me an insight to be a bit more creative with our code. It also gave me an insight as to what can be very hard to code. Nevertheless, this lab was very fun to code.

*Lab 4
  I really enjoyed lab 4 because we got to learn all about blackjack, and even code it so we can play it. Although this lab was tougher than the rest, I still think it was the most fun in coding Iâ€™ve had in the entire semester. This blackjack lab opened my eyes to what really can be done in coding, and that its all up to our imagination.
